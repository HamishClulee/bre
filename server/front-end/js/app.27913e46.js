Loud noises and a cloud rising from the crater were noticed, then the ejection of bombs and blocks. On February 24, 1963, highly viscous lava flows began to travel down the northern flank of the volcano, reaching a length of 7 km in about 18 to 20 days and an elevation of 510 m above sea level.","The flows were about 0.5-0.8 km wide and 30-40 m thick. Rough estimates indicate a total volume of these flows of about 50 million cubic meters. After that phase, the eruption became more and more explosive, and on March 17, 1963, the paroxysmal sub-Plinian eruption took place, generating an eruption column of 8-10 km height that collapsed to form devastating pyroclastic flows.","These flows reached distances of up to 15 km from the crater following valleys to the south and east, at speeds of about 60 km/hour. Many villages were destroyed and more than 1000 people lost their lives. Heavy tephra fall occurred in areas west of the volcano, where up to 50-70 cm of ash were deposited. In May, the south peak of the crater wall collapsed, lowering its height for about 200 meters. The lowest crater wall at present is the upper end of Langon river (2600 m)."]}}]},Y={C:z},Z={components:{fpsection:L,fpgrid:J},name:"home",data:function(){return{c:Y}},mounted:function(){},methods:{},computed:{}},Q=Z,X=(a("538d"),Object(p["a"])(Q,C,D,!1,null,"38e05dbc",null));X.options.__file="home.vue";var ee=X.exports,te=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement;e._self._c;return e._m(0)},ae=[function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,a=e._self._c||t;return a("section",{attrs:{id:"not-found"}},[a("div",{staticClass:"circles"},[a("p",{staticClass:"text-color-control"},[e._v("404"),a("br"),a("small",{staticClass:"text-color-control"},[e._v("PAGE NOT FOUND")])]),a("span",{staticClass:"circle big"}),a("span",{staticClass:"circle med"}),a("span",{staticClass:"circle small"})])])}],ie={name:"PageNotFound",data:function(){return{}},mounted:function(){},methods:{},computed:{}},ne=ie,oe=(a("ae2b"),Object(p["a"])(ne,te,ae,!1,null,"6723a7b3",null));oe.options.__file="notfound.vue";var re=oe.exports,le=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,a=e._self._c||t;return a("div",{staticClass:"tour-container"},[a("div",{staticClass:"tour-heading"},[a("h1",[e._v(e._s(e.content.title))])]),a("h3",{staticClass:"tour-price"},[e._v(e._s(e.content.description))]),a("tourimggrid",{attrs:{imgs:e.content.content.imgs}}),a("div",e._l(e.content.content.description,function(t,i){return a("p",{key:i},[e._v(e._s(t))])})),a("enquire")],1)},se=[],ue=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,i=e._self._c||t;return i("div",{staticClass:"img-grid-container"},e._l(e.imgs,function(e,t){return i("div",{directives:[{name:"show",rawName:"v-show",value:t<6,expression:"ind < 6"}],key:t,staticClass:"img-container"},[i("img",{attrs:{src:a("1771")("./"+String(e))}})])}))},ce=[],pe={name:"tourimggrid",props:{imgs:Array},methods:{buildlink:function(){return""}}},ge=pe,he=(a("65c3"),Object(p["a"])(ge,ue,ce,!1,null,"38958b04",null));he.options.__file="tourimggrid.vue";var de=he.exports,me=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,a=e._self._c||t;return a("div",{staticClass:"form-container"},[a("p",{staticClass:"validation-message"},[e._v(e._s(e.validationMessage))]),a("div",{staticClass:"field"},[a("label",{staticClass:"label"},[e._v("Your Email Address")]),a("div",{staticClass:"control"},[a("input",{directives:[{name:"model",rawName:"v-model",value:e.email,expression:"email"}],staticClass:"input",attrs:{type:"email",placeholder:"Email address"},domProps:{value:e.email},on:{input:function(t){t.target.composing||(e.email=t.target.value)}}})])]),a("div",{staticClass:"field"},[a("label",{staticClass:"label"},[e._v("Your Phone Number")]),a("div",{staticClass:"control"},[a("input",{directives:[{name:"model",rawName:"v-model",value:e.phone,expression:"phone"}],staticClass:"input",attrs:{type:"text",placeholder:"Phone Number"},domProps:{value:e.phone},on:{input:function(t){t.target.composing||(e.phone=t.target.value)}}})])]),a("div",{staticClass:"field",attrs:{id:"details"}},[a("label",{staticClass:"label"},[e._v("Type Your message below")]),a("div",{staticClass:"control"},[a("textarea",{directives:[{name:"model",rawName:"v-model",value:e.message,expression:"message"}],staticClass:"textarea",attrs:{placeholder:"Ask us a question!",rows:"5"},domProps:{value:e.message},on:{input:function(t){t.target.composing||(e.message=t.target.value)}}})])]),e.networkInProgress?a("section",{staticClass:"network-progress"},[a("h6",[e._v("Thanks for your interest in Baby Aid NZ!
